## :book: How it works

* Scan the networks.
* Capture a handshake (can't be used without a valid handshake, it's necessary to verify the password)
* Use WEB Interface *
* Launch a FakeAP instance to imitate the original access point
* Spawns a MDK3 process, which deauthenticates all users connected to the target network, so they can be lured to connect to the FakeAP and enter the WPA password.
* A fake DNS server is launched in order to capture all DNS requests and redirect them to the host running the script
* A captive portal is launched in order to serve a page, which prompts the user to enter their WPA password
* Each submitted password is verified by the handshake captured earlier
* The attack will automatically terminate, as soon as a correct password is submitted

##  :heavy_exclamation_mark: Requirements

A linux operating system. We recommend Kali Linux 2 or Kali 2016.1 rolling. Kali 2 & 2016 support the latest aircrack-ng versions. A external wifi card is recommended.
